JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The token is digitally signed and contains a payload that can be verified and trusted.

Why use JSON Web Token (JWT) in our project?

Here are some reasons why we might use JWT in our project:

Authentication and Authorization: JWT can be used to authenticate and authorize users. When a user logs in, we can generate a JWT token that contains their user ID and other relevant information. This token can then be sent with each subsequent request to verify the user's identity and permissions.
Stateless Authentication: JWT is stateless, meaning that the server does not need to store any information about the user's session. This makes it easier to scale our application and reduces the risk of session fixation attacks.
